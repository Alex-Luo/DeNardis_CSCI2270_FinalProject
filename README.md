# DeNardis_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
We are creating the game Hangman as our final project.  When the game begins it will read in a text file 
of words and enqueue the words: head, body, right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg in a separate function. 
The first word will be generated to the user as a series of underscores (characters)
corresponding to each letter of the word.  The user will then be prompted to guess a letter. If
the letter is correct it will replace the corresponding underscore character. If the letter is incorrect the first
word of the queue will be dequeued and printed to the screen.  The user will than be prompted for the next letter
and so on until they either solve the word or are hanged.
